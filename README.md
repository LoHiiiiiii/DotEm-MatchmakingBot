A simple matchmaking bot for discord. The basic gist is allowing searching arbitary id's and the bot pings everyone searching for the same id when enough players are searching. The bells and whistles include features like adding complete names and aliases for ids, making the bot DM you when a specific id is listened on a specific server, and adding the ability to join other people's searches by simple pressing a button that appears when someone does search for the id with a command.
